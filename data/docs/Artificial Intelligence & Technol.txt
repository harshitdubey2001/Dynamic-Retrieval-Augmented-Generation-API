# Artificial Intelligence & Technology Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Major AI Companies

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization best known for developing the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series of models, including GPT-3, GPT-4, and GPT-5. These models are widely used for chatbots, code generation, summarization, and reasoning tasks.

Microsoft is a multinational technology company closely associated with the Windows operating system. Microsoft has also partnered with OpenAI and integrates AI technologies into products like Microsoft Azure, Copilot, and Office 365.

Google is a global technology leader that developed the Transformer architecture, which forms the basis of modern large language models. Google’s AI research division is known as DeepMind.

Meta (formerly Facebook) focuses on open-source AI development and created models like LLaMA. Meta applies AI heavily in social media, recommendation systems, and virtual reality.

## Operating Systems

Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft. It is widely used on personal computers and laptops around the world.

Linux is an open-source operating system commonly used on servers, cloud infrastructure, and development environments.

macOS is an operating system developed by Apple for Macintosh computers.

## Cloud & Infrastructure

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers services such as virtual servers, databases, storage, and machine learning tools.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform offering AI services, virtual machines, and enterprise solutions.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides cloud computing services with strong AI and data analytics capabilities.

## AI Concepts

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data. Examples include GPT models, Gemini, Claude, and LLaMA.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines document retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and grounded responses.

A reranker is often used in RAG systems to reorder retrieved documents based on relevance before sending them to the language model.

Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that allow semantic similarity search.

## Miscellaneous Facts

Python is the most popular programming language for AI and machine learning.

FAISS is a library used for efficient similarity search in vector databases.

Cohere provides APIs for embeddings and reranking models.

Hybrid search combines keyword-based search with vector-based semantic search.
